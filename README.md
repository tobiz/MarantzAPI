# MarantzAPI
Python API for controlling Marantz 1604 (maybe others) over LAN

The MarantzAPI enables Marantz AV devices supporting LAN connections to be controlled by Python applications.
The API has been tested against a Marantz 1604 AV Amp.  In order to use the API a number of Python modules will have to be installed, these can be derived from the "import" directives.

A test script is included to test correct function of the code when installed.
